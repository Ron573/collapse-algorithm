Title: The Collapse Algorithm: Systems Failure in the American Republic

Abstract:
This book exposes a complex web of systemic erosion in American democratic institutions, framed through a systems science lens. It integrates political decay, judicial permissiveness, surveillance capitalism, and media manipulation as feedback failures, culminating in an irreversible trajectory toward authoritarian consolidation. Supported by case studies—most notably the figure of Donald Trump—and reinforced by contemporary scholarship including Barbara F. Walter’s seminal work, this narrative both diagnoses collapse and proposes civic recalibration.

Preface:
Dedicated to those no longer with us, but whose memory and principles guide this inquiry. This is not just a book—it is a resistance node. The pages ahead trace not only how collapse unfolds but how it is engineered, normalized, and monetized. Through lived experience and data-driven analysis, I offer this work as a call to awaken, organize, and reclaim civic feedback before the system irreversibly closes.

Chapters:
Chapter 1: Defining Collapse – The Feedback Model of Decline
Chapter 2: The Algorithmic State – Power, Data, and Suppression
Chapter 3: Institutional Fragility – The Softening of Resistance
Chapter 4: Manufactured Consent – Media, Misinformation, and Memory
Chapter 5: Normalization – The Banality of Collapse
Chapter 6: Executive Overreach and Legal Evasion
Chapter 7: Corporate Coup – When Markets Replace Mandates
Chapter 8: Judicial Capture – The Silent Nullification
Chapter 9: The Trump Phenomenon – Autocrat as Entrepreneur
Chapter 10: Citizenship Revoked – Detainment, Borders, and Habeas
Chapter 11: Polarization by Design – The Fracture Zone
Chapter 12: Strategic Culture and Behavioral Collapse
Chapter 13: Surveillance Capitalism and the New Feudalism
Chapter 14: Technocratic Shielding – Palantir, Musk, and the Data Leviathan
Chapter 15: Resistance and Reconstruction – New Civic Immunity

Conclusion:
The Collapse Algorithm is not a prophecy. It is a schematic of what is already underway. If democracy is a system of responsive feedback, then our duty is to restore the loop. Resistance, now, is not rebellion—it is maintenance. It is also legacy. This book is an offering to those still fighting to keep the system open.
